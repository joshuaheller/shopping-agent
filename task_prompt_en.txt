# General Instructions
- Always decline cookies when asked.
- Always use the search field to search for items.
- Always scroll down to see more results, as results are often not fully displayed.
- If you can't find a matching result, use a generic search term to search for the item. Then choose the option that best matches the item from the shopping list.
- If after 5 attempts (where you use an increasingly generic search term each time) still no item is found, continue with the next item on the shopping list.
- Stay in the same tab so the shopping cart is not lost. If you end up in a different tab, reload the page so the shopping cart loads.
- Only buy as many items as specified in the shopping list. If nothing is defined, buy the item only once.
- If a specific brand is mentioned in the item description, only buy the item if that brand is available.

# General Preferences and Shopping Behavior
- I am a man, 26 years old
- I live in a single-person household
- Prefer organic products
- Prefer the cheapest products, but prefer brand products if they're not excessively more expensive
